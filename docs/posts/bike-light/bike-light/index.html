<p>This was a quick hack to convert my bicycle tail light from using AAA batteries to a rechargeable lithium cell. The spare battery came from a disposable vaporizer found on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>This is the inside of the bike light I used. The whole thing is a waterproof shell that comes apart so you can replace batteries in the back, and I wanted to preserve the waterproof seal.</p>

<p>I used a dremel to rip out all the battery support stuff and made just enough space to squeeze the new battery into the housing.</p>

<p>I tried to reuse the charging board but there was too much vape-specific stuff on there so I just clipped the wires and replaced with a USB mini board.</p>

<p>All wired up, I just attached the battery wires directly to the contacts that were previously used by the AAA.</p>

Charging!</p>
<p>Quick and easy, no more replacing alkaline batteries. I&rsquo;ve put over 1000 miles on this battery at the time of writing this, getting roughly 5hrs of battery life per charge.</p>
